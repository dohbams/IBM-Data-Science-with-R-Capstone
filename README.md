## A Walk Through My First Data Science Project

Greetings! Let's rewind the clock about a year ago and revisit a milestone in my data science journey - the Bike Sharing Demand Predictor project. This was part of the IBM Data Science with R certification; the capstone project, and it represents my early steps into the world of data science.

## Back to the Beginning

Picture me, a curious learner, grappling with the task of predicting bike sharing demand based on weather and temporal data. I'll admit I was lost 90% of the time. Notwithstanding, I dived into the intricacies of the datasets, including the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set, Global Bike Sharing Systems Dataset from Wikipedia, and World Cities Data.

## Navigating the Data Maze: My Experience

### 1. **Data Mining and Wrangling**

The journey commenced with data mining and wrangling - a necessary chore to obtain and then untangle the complexities of raw data. I was introduced to the concepts of web scraping and API calls. The goal in this stage was to ensure that the dataset was clean, laying the groundwork for what lay ahead.

### 2. **EDA**

Armed with RSQLite and ggplot2, I morphed into a data detective during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. This was propbably the most enjoyable phase of the capstone project. Here, I learnt how to connect to, create and query a database all within R! This task enabled me to unveil patterns and trends in the datasets using both simple and complex queries. I even used a sub-query; again, all within R!

### 3. **Linear Regression Chronicles**

The predictive modeling phase introduced me to the world of linear regression. This was the very first ML model I learnt about and applied. Crafting a model to predict bike demand based on weather conditions wasn't an easy feat. But when my model, after several tweaks and iterations scored an accuracy of 74%, I felt on top of the world. It's a pretty modest accuracy score but it meant the world to me back then after creating models that could barely achieve 70% accuracy.

### 4. **Shiny App: Bridging Data and Visuals**

Enter the Shiny package - the tool that transformed predictions into an interactive web app. This was where data met aesthetics, creating a visual narrative of weather updates and bike demand in urban locations. This was by far the most frustrating and painful part of the capstone project. At some point I abandoned it for weeks. I felt clueless, inadequate, and like I hadn't learnt a thing throughout the course certification. I took a whole lot of willpower (and copying and pasting other people's code) to come up with the first app. I remember feeling like a fraud back then because I couldn't write the code myself. In hindsight I was very hard on myself.

### 5. **A Year Later: Reflection and Refinement**

Fast forward a year, and I revisited this project. Armed with more knowledge, the process became a refinement rather than a reinvention. My sheer willpower and passion paid off and now I'm glad I can come up with something I wouldn't have dreamed of a year ago. This iterative approach is proof that learning is not linear. It grows organically and your passion and discipline plays a major role.

## Words of Encouragement

To fellow data enthusiasts embarking on their journey, here's a nugget of wisdom: Your first project may not be flawless, and that's absolutely fine. My initial attempt, while not a masterpiece, served as a stepping stone. Embrace the learning curve, persist in your efforts, and let your projects evolve over time.

## Take a Peek Behind the Code and Explore the New App!!

Feel free to explore the app, code, datasets, and documentation. I really hope this account of my early data endeavors, serves as an inspiration and provide insights for your own learning adventure. Good luck!
