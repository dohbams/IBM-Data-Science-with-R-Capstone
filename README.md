## A Walk Through My First Data Science Project

Greetings! Let's rewind the clock about a year ago and revisit a milestone in my data science journey - the Bike Sharing Demand Predictor project. This was part of the IBM Data Science with R certification, the capstone project and it represents my early steps into the world of data science.

## Back to the Beginning

Picture me, a curious learner, grappling with the task of predicting bike sharing demand based on weather and temporal data. Armed with determination and a fair share of uncertainty, I dived into the intricacies of datasets, including the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set, Global Bike Sharing Systems Dataset from Wikipedia, and World Cities Data.

## Navigating the Data Maze: My Experience

### 1. **Data Wrangling Realities**

The journey commenced with data wrangling - a necessary chore to untangle the complexities of raw data. Ensuring a clean dataset was my initial triumph, laying the groundwork for what lay ahead.

### 2. **EDA: A Dive into Data Detective Work**

Armed with RSQLite and ggplot2, I morphed into a data detective during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. Unveiling patterns and trends was akin to solving a puzzle, revealing the stories hidden within the datasets.

### 3. **Linear Regression Chronicles**

The predictive modeling phase introduced me to the world of linear regression. Crafting a model to predict bike demand based on weather conditions felt like peering into a crystal ball, albeit with a touch of data science realism.

### 4. **Shiny Dashboard: Bridging Data and Visuals**

Enter the Shiny package - the tool that transformed predictions into an interactive dashboard. This was where data met aesthetics, creating a visual narrative of weather updates and bike demand in urban locations.

### 5. **A Year Later: Reflection and Refinement**

Fast forward a year, and I revisited this project. Armed with more knowledge, the process became a refinement rather than a reinvention. This iterative approach showcased the organic growth inherent in the learning process.

## Words of Encouragement

To fellow data enthusiasts embarking on their journey, here's a nugget of wisdom: Your first project may not be flawless, and that's absolutely fine. My initial attempt, while not a masterpiece, served as a stepping stone. Embrace the learning curve, persist in your efforts, and let your projects evolve over time.
